# SP-Assignment

This is a repository created for submitting the assignment assigned to me in the course "Structured Programming". We were given seven tasks related to 
functions and were told to solve them. The questions for the problems are given below:

Task 01: Sum of Two Numbers:
Write a function add that takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum.

Task 02:  Calculate Average:
Define a function calculateAverage that takes two floats as arguments and returns the average of these two numbers.

Task 03: Check Even or Odd:
Write a function isEven that checks if a given integer is even. The function should return a 1 if the number is even and 0 if it's odd.

Task 04: Determine Which Circle is Greater:
Write a function findArea that takes one integers as parameter and returns the area of circle. In main function take two radius as inputs and print the area of greater circle.

Task 05: Find Minimum and Maximum:
Create two functions: findMin and findMax. Each should take an array of integers and the array's size and return the minimum and maximum value, respectively.

Task 06: Count Occurrences:
Write a function named countOccurrences that counts how many times a given integer appears in an array of integers.

Task 07: Reverse Array:
Define a function reverseArray that takes an array of integers and its size as arguments and reverses the array. The function doesn't need to return a value (it should alter the array in place and print them).
